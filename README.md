## Upload a project 
To upload a program on the Pi Pico and make it the default program that will run on the board at boot, then simply save your program in a **main.py** file directly on the board.

Using VS Code, it seem to have a little bug when you've a workspace with multiple project folder. To avoid any problem, open the folder you want to uplad directly in VS Code.
  

## Examples : 
- **blink** and **blinkExternalLed** show how to declare and use GPIO.


### Blinky External LED
This example show how to use GPIO in output mode.
